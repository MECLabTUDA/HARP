# Maybe an option to apply frodo augmentations separately
# Write instructions for anomalib training (Maybe a general instruction to use any of the detection algorithm)
# Analyse all artifact detection at once and then do cleaning one by one
# Check if timing is okay
# Parametrise all things to config
